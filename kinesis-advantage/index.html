  <div class="post-content"><p>The <a href="https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">Kinesis Advantage2</a> is a bizarre spaceship keyboard that only
appeals to <del>über nerds</del> cool people who like maximizing efficiency of things that don't even occur to the
general population. Also, sometimes people have RSI or wrist pain or whatever. I'm a member of the first group (of
cools) because I long-ago solved my wrist and hand pain with Microsoft ergonomic keyboards.</p>
<p>I don't know when this post will be published. I wanted to start it now so I could document my journey of trying to use
this crazy keyboard. I received mine on January 23, 2017. For reference, my prior keyboard which I enjoyed quite a bit
was a Microsoft Sculpt. Before that I used the Microsoft 4000 and before that it was just regular cheapo Logitechs or
whatever.</p>
<h2 id="first-impressions-day-one-and-two">First Impressions: Day One and Two</h2>
<p>It seems like a well-made device. I have not had a keyboard with mechanical switches in many years; this has Cherry
Browns which are supposed to be a something-something type of switch I'm not even going to pretend to care. (I am
purposely stopping myself from going down the key switch rabbit hole, because my other preferences are already weird and
specific enough.) Regardless of whatever specs, they feel nice.</p>
<p>I love the ability to remap keys on the keyboard itself. With my other keyboards I've resorted to <a href="https://github.com/deathlyfrantic/dotfiles/blob/af6f9af7923a98d11fa373f909efbfee52216b3c/keyboard.hwdb">custom udev
rules</a> to
remap <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>; here it's a few keystrokes to do it. I also remapped some other keys:
swapped <kbd>Backspace</kbd> and regular <kbd>Space</kbd> (I'm a rare left-thumb spacer), assigned the <kbd>Logo</kbd>
key to <kbd>Delete</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd> to <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>PageUp</kbd> to <kbd>Logo</kbd>, <kbd>PageDown</kbd> to
<kbd>PageUp</kbd>, <kbd>Esc</kbd> to <kbd>PageDown</kbd>, <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> to <kbd>Esc</kbd>, <kbd>Delete</kbd> to
left <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd> to left <kbd>Alt</kbd>. Apparently the default layout really did not suit me.</p>
<p>The thumb clusters were a bit odd but I got used to them pretty quickly, actually. Within a few hours, using my thumbs
for <kbd>Backspace</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> became natural. In fact, the first time I used the keyboard on my laptop
(within a few hours of getting the Advantage2), I was trying to backspace with my thumb. It seems like a very natural
motion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I am not having as much luck adapting to the rest of the keyboard. I am mostly to the point where I can
type letters ok. About an hour after I got the keyboard I played a game of <a href="http://play.typeracer.com/">TypeRacer</a> and
scored 35wpm with about 87% accuracy. A day later I'm up to 67wpm with 91% accuracy. (For reference, I generally type in
the 100-120wpm range with accuracy in the high 90s.) I have no doubt that's going to continue to improve. I guess my
typing technique is pretty bad - I generally only use three fingers (first, middle and ring) on each hand - and the
Advantage2 is very unforgiving of that. So I'm gradually improving my technique and eventually I'll be as fast as I was.</p>
<p>The thing that is very inconvenient is the location of punctuation and control keys. I'm a programmer, and punctuation
is a big part of doing my job (even in languages that don't use a ton of it, like Python). To make the Advantage2 fit
into a small space, a lot of the keys commonly used in programming were moved to different places - the <kbd>+/=</kbd>
key, for example, is where the <kbd>~</kbd> key is normally. The <kbd>~</kbd> key is below the <kbd>Z</kbd> (or
<kbd>:</kbd> in Dvorak), which is not a space where I'm accustomed to having a key. The brackets are possibly the worst
part. They are below the <kbd>&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>?</kbd> keys and it's essentially impossible for me to press them without
looking yet. I also have a lot of trouble hitting the correct parenthesis keys - I tend to hit <kbd>*</kbd> when I want
<kbd>(</kbd> and <kbd>(</kbd> when I want <kbd>)</kbd>. And the arrow keys, which as a Vim user are not at all important
to me generally, keep getting in my way. It's about 50/50 whether I hit <kbd>C</kbd> or <kbd>→</kbd>; I often end up
with the cursor in the middle of a word I'm typing. However, when I then try to correct that word, by using
<kbd>←</kbd>, I have to look to find it.</p>
<p>This is the part that worries me about the Advantage2. I accept that my technique will get better and I'll adjust to
words ok because I've already seen improvements. But punctuation keys are so important for my profession and I have yet
to see any progress on getting them down. I'm as bad with brackets now as I was yesterday despite hours of use. And if I
can't manage to adjust, there's no way I'll be able to stick with the Advantage2.</p>
<p>Another weird thing is that despite the general impression that the keyboard <em>can</em> relieve pain (I know this is not
proven and Kinesis does not make any claims to this effect), I'm actually experiencing a noticeable amount of pain on
the tops of my hands in the area of the tendons. I believe this may be related to the upward angle of the keyboard,
which is not adjustable. The Sculpt slopes downward from the back. But perhaps that is because I have had to change my
typing technique and I am now using my muscles in a way I am not accustomed to. This could also be a combination of the
setup of my desk and chair, or my posture, or any number of other factors. So I'm not saying the Advantage2 is <em>causing</em>
this, just that something is and I may need to make other adjustments to use it effectively.</p>
<p>At this point, I do like the keyboard in general, but it's going to require much more adaptation on my part than I had
anticipated. When I first switched to the 4000 from a traditional keyboard I could pretty much type at my full speed
within a few hours. I naïvely expected the same type of transition in this case. That was mistake on my part. (Kinesis
says most users adapt within 2-4 <em>weeks</em>.)</p>
<h2 id="day-3-continuum">Day 3: Continuum</h2>
<p>I thought a lot about the Advantage2 as I was trying to get to sleep last night (because I am cool), and came upon the
realization that it might not be for me. My aforementioned &quot;bad&quot; typing technique may not actually be bad, per se;
perhaps it's just <em>different</em>. Thinking about it, my hands tend to move a lot when I type on a more conventional
keyboard, and the Advantage2 is really designed for zero (or minimal) hand movement. That caused a lot of adaptation
friction for me.</p>
<p>And is the technique the Advantage2 imposes upon the user necessarily better? Maybe for some, or even most; but I've
been typing this way for 30-ish years, and forgive me for sounding like a 65-year-old chain smoker, but it hasn't hurt
me yet.</p>
<p>That point is, I think, important. Because after two days with the Advantage2, I was experiencing hand and wrist pain. I
am not saying the Advantage2 was the direct cause - it's just as likely my posture when sitting at my desk does not mesh
well with its shape - but ergonomics are not an exact science and what works for most will not necessarily work for all.
What I <em>am</em> saying, though, is my entire setup worked fine, and when I switched to the Advantage2 from the Sculpt, it
stopped working fine.</p>
<h2 id="day-uh-20-i-guess-it-s-over">Day, uh, 20, I guess?: It's Over</h2>
<p>Oh gosh, I nearly forgot about my experiment with the Advantage2 entirely. I sent it back on the fourth day of having
it. It just wasn't going to work for me. The mechanical switches were great, and I miss them a bit, but otherwise I'm
happy with my Sculpt. Having a semi-normal key layout is far more important to me than I realized. I'm currently eyeing
the <a href="http://matias.ca/ergopro/pc/">Matias Ergo Pro</a>.</p>
